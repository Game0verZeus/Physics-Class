# Physics-Class
As a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming academic term, this project provides a set of Python functions to help students calculate fundamental physical properties. The project covers basic concepts such as temperature conversion, force, energy, and work calculations.

## Functions

- `f_to_c`: Converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
- `c_to_f`: Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- `get_force`: Calculates force as the product of mass and acceleration.
- `get_energy`: Computes the energy of a mass given a constant.
- `get_work`: Determines the work done as force exerted over a distance.

## Setup Instructions

To use these functions, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer.
